## Part 1: Face detection
In this section we will use Haar cascades to detect a face.

Here are some results of what you can expect:

## Part 2: Optical Character Recognition


## Part 3: 3D stereo reconstruction
In this section we will reconstruct a 3D representation of an object.

First we will capture stereo images of the object.

Then we will calculate the point cloud.

We will then move to MeshLab to further refine this point cloud into a Mesh.
